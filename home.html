						WHAT IS THE PPL SPLIT?
					</h2>
					<p class="px-4">
						The PPL split is a workout routine that specifically means <span class="bold">P</span>ush, <span class="bold">P</span>ull and <span class="bold">L</span>egs, hence why it's abbreviated as PPL. This program encourages you to exercise at least three days a week. In those three days, you are to assign pushing exercises, pulling exercises and leg exercises in each of those days.
					</p>

					<p class="px-4 py-3">
						For example, during push days, you do "pushing" types of exercises. These exercises normally target your chest, shoulders and triceps. Exercises usually included on this day are:
					</p>

					<h4 class="text-white p-4">THE BENCH PRESS</h4>

					<h4 class="text-white p-4">THE OVERHEAD PRESS</h4>

					<img src="assets/images/barbell-military-press-990x724.png" class="img-fluid">


					<p class="px-4 py-3 mt-5">
						During pull days, you do "pulling" types of exercises. These exercises normally target your back and biceps. Exercises usually included on this day are:
					</p>

					<h4 class="text-white p-4">PULL-UPS</h4>

					<h4 class="text-white p-4">BARBELL BICEP CURLS</h4>

					<img src="assets/images/barbell-preacher-curl-990x593.png" class="img-fluid">

					<p class="px-4 py-3">
						During leg days, you do leg exercises. These exercises normally target your all of the muscle groups of your legs - the hamstrings, calves, glutes and the quadriceps. Exercises usually included on this day are:
					</p>

					<h4 class="text-white p-4">SQUATS</h4>

						WHY DO WE RECOMMEND THE PPL SPLIT?
					</h2>

					<p class="px-4 py-2">
						If you've already started experimenting with lifting weights and different programs before, chances are, you've gone through a lot of changes to your workout patterns. There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, it is encouraged to switch up your patterns every now and then once you've plateaud. It's just that we encourage you to try out the PPL split for a couple of weeks, not just for its efficient grouping of exercises but also to jolt your muscles using a different type of program.
					</p>

					<p class="px-4 py-2">Let's expound for a bit. Let's say your splits for the week are chest/triceps for day 1, legs/biceps for day 2 and back/shoulder for day 3. There's nothing really wrong with it as you pretty much hit all the muscle groups in an entire week but it could be better.</p>

					<p class="px-4 pt-2 pb-4">If you were to adopt the PPL routine, pairing shoulders, chest and triceps together would be really beneficial because most of the movements in their exercises uses the same muscle group. The bench press is a compound exercise that works the chest, triceps and shoulders. An overhead tricep extension works the triceps. The overhead press works the shoulders and triceps. Grouping these three exercises within the same day would be beneficial to the growth of your muscles as opposed to including barbell curls or lateral pulldowns in it.</p>
